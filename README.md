### Dashboard Features

- Genre

You can checkout the genre you want or just leave it blank

- Years

In default, I included all the movies within 30 years.
You can adjust the year of the movie it published for your interest.

- Directors

Have a certain interest with specific directors?
Type and check the name of the director and it can display the movie that you want.

- Number of votes

I also included the high votes of movie as the most discussed and reviewed movie within the period you selected.
It can act as cross checking the rating on the above graph since the rating become authentic for more votes.
