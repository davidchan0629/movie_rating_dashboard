## Movie rating dashboard

Don't know watching which movie at night or parties?
Just checkout the high rating movie in the dashboard with you selected option.

### Dashboard Features

- Genre

You can checkout the genre you want or just leave it blank

- Years

In default, I included all the movies within 30 years.
You can adjust the year of the movie it published for your interest.

- Number of votes

I also included the high votes of movie as the most discussed and reviewed movie within the period you selected.
It can act as cross checking the rating on the above graph since the rating become authentic for more votes.
